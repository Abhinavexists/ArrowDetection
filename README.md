# ArrowDetection
Arrow Detection using OpenCV
This project is an implementation of arrow detection using the OpenCV library in Python. The aim is to detect and recognize arrows in an image or video stream. The project utilizes computer vision techniques, such as image processing and contour detection, to identify and extract arrow shapes.

Prerequisites
Before running the code, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.x
OpenCV
NumPy
You can install OpenCV and NumPy using pip:

shell
Copy code
pip install opencv-python
pip install numpy
Usage
To run the arrow detection code, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
shell
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Abhinavks1405/ArrowDetection
cd arrow-detection
Run the Python script:
shell
Copy code
python arrow_detection.py --image path/to/image.jpg
Replace path/to/image.jpg with the path to the image you want to test.

Approach
Load the input image.
Convert the image to grayscale for further processing.
Apply edge detection using the Canny algorithm to detect edges.
Find contours in the edge image.
Filter the contours based on their shape, specifically looking for arrow-like shapes.
Draw bounding boxes around the detected arrows.
Display the final image with arrows highlighted.
Results
Include some example images or videos showcasing the results of your arrow detection algorithm. You can also mention the accuracy or any limitations of your approach.
